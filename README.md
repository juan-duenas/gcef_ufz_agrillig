# GCEF_ufz_agrillig

These are files associated with the analysis of amplicon sequencing of a dry re-wet experiment performed in early 2024.

Data was collected as part of a collaboration between the global change experimental facility (GCEF) managed by UFZ in Bad Lauchstädt (Saxony-Anhalt - DE) and post-docs associated to the AG Rillig at Freie Universität Berlin.
