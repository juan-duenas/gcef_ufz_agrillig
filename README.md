# GCEF_ufz_agrillig

These are files associated with the molecular measurements of the dry re-wet experiment of AG Rillig in 2024. This is a collaboration between the global change experimental facility (GCEF) manage by UFZ in Bad Lauchstädt (near Halle) and post-docs associated to the AG Rillig at FU Berlin.

All files are contained as an R project.

## Contents

-   R script -\> *analysis_script.r*

-   qPCR data -\> *bf1.csv*

-   Illumina sequencing data for 16S (Bacteria). -\> *DR_bac_raw_rar.RData*

    This image contains objects with the raw data and the rarefied data. Tables are contained as phyloseq type objects. Each phyloseq object is composed of: ASV abundance tables, taxonomy tables, and experimental information.
